ANA says it will resume JVs with Lufthansa and United after restructure,"By Alex Lennane 04/10/2023

NYK Line’s sale of Nippon Cargo Airlines to All Nippon Airways’ (ANA) has been delayed for four months – but ANA’s consequent suspension of its joint-ventures with United Airlines and Lufthansa is a temporary measure, it says, it wants to resume the JVs after it has restructured.

Its interline agreements with the two carriers remain in place.

ANA said last week it was delaying its takeover of NCA, which was due to happen on Sunday. It said the share exchange would now take place on 1 February.

“Taking into consideration the time to complete the review of the business combination that will result from the share exchange by the relevant authorities in Japan and foreign countries, etc, the company decided to change the effective date of the share exchange,” it said.

The balance sheets of the two carriers will be consolidated from the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ending March 2024.

The airline also announced it was suspending its hitherto successful partnerships with Lufthansa and United. But a spokesperson told The Loadstar: “Technically, the joint-venture partnerships with United and Lufthansa Cargo will not be terminated, but suspended. While we will focus on the restructuring of our cargo business at hand, ANA hopes to resume the joint-venture in the future.”

The spokesperson added: “With the suspension of the joint-venture partnership, coordination of flight schedules, pricing and cargo space will be halted. However, as an interline agreement is in place with United and Lufthansa Cargo, ANA will continue to be able to offer space on the respective partner airlines, and vice versa.”

ANA operates four 767 freighters and two 777 freighters; NCA has eight 747 freighters, which ANA has pledged to take on.

The sale of NCA by NYK Line, announced in March, bucked the trend for shipping lines working with airlines. NYK acquired the airline fully in 2010, “with the aim of becoming a comprehensive logistics company offering ocean, land and air transport”.

However, it said costs were too high, after NCA became plagued with aircraft maintenance issues. NYK said at the time: “The continuous introduction of new aircraft to expand the operation and maintenance system, and the continuous training of personnel engaged in operation and maintenance required a considerable expenditure.

“In the highly volatile business environment of airfreight, NCA has been facing challenges in expanding its business scale at a level that is commensurate with such costs.”",0,transport

It’s estimated that almost 40 per cent of the freshwater in the city is used for non-potable purposes and can be replaced by (unused) treated wastewater ­ –Shreya Nath, CSEI

Of 1,265 MLD, most treated, reusable wastewater ingoes to waste; experts say this can change, study suggests waysBengaluru generates around 2,000 MLD of wastewater each day, of which 735 MLD goes untreated and 1,265 MLD is treated in centralised and decentralised sewage treatment plants (STPs). Most of the treated water doesn’t get used and is discharged into stormwater channels, stated a study conducted by Centre for Social and Environmental Innovation (CSEI), Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and Environment (ATREE). Experts said, this wastewater can, instead, be put to many uses (other than drinking).“It’s estimated that almost 40 per cent of the freshwater in the city is used for non-potable purposes and can easily be replaced by (unused) treated wastewater. The reuse purpose should be determined based on the quality of the reclaimed water. For example, reclaimed water of very high quality can be used for construction purposes. Water of lower quality, still complying with the pollution control board’s standards, can be used for greening public spaces,” said, director of Cities and Towns, CSEI.Further, the study highlights: While the city has a large number of apartment-scale STPs, gated communities are unable to comply with the mandate of 100 per cent wastewater reuse.Urban local bodies have been promoting decentralised sewage treatment to build typologies that house large populations like multistorey apartments and commercial complexes to help bridge the sewage gap in cities.“We conducted interviews with resident welfare associations of 20 apartment complexes to get a better understanding and overview of the ground reality. We found that almost 50 per cent of the apartment complexes did not comply with the Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) mandate,” said Nath.ZLD is a water treatment process, dating back to the ‘70s, where all water is recovered and contaminants are reduced to solid waste.The interviews revealed smaller apartment complexes with less than 50 units found it particularly difficult to utilise excess treated wastewater due to low demand.“Wastewater treatment at a smaller scale tends to generate very high operation and maintenance costs. Therefore, the systems are usually not well maintained. Capital investment is another big factor… Mechanical equipment such as blowers and pumps associated with treatment systems for a 50 KLD plant versus a 500 KLD is not very different, but the access to the capital investment based on the unit sales for different plants is very different. So, the smaller plants are often under-designed,” said, the urban water management lead at CSEI.As per the study, a viable way to reuse the wastewater in the city can be found in the construction industry.In 2019,and Sewerage Board () mandated the use of treated wastewater from decentralised STPs for construction. Despite this, most builders and architects are hesitant to reuse the water for construction.According to Singh, the key to using reclaimed water in the construction industry is to establish a baseline of the quality of water required for safe reuse. The next steps would be to find high quality water and set up good monitoring protocols and a robust transportation network.“Once the baseline is established it will go a long way in building trust in wastewater safety, which is a concern among new homebuyers. We have partnered with two start-ups that aim to bridge these gaps and focus on water quality and quantity monitoring. We are looking at creating a live interface that links buyers and sellers and facilitates wastewater transportation,” said Nath.",0,industrial

“Jobs requiring a combination of digital and non-cognitive skills is expected to tend to be better in demand”India's population growth and economic development requires robust infrastructure in roads, railways, aviation & ports etc. There has been emphasis on balanced development in all sectors of infrastructure whether it is roads, railways, ports, real estate, water, aviation, energy or even buildings of national importance. India on cusp of returning to high growth trajectory, will become world’s third largest economy by 2027-28 as mentioned by Arvind Panagariya , Eminent economist. India's goal of achieving a $5 trillion economy by 2025 can be met by promoting quality and time-bound development plans. According to IBEF report, the infrastructure sector in India is predicted to grow at a CAGR of 8.2 per cent by 2027. Signifying the need for robust enhancement of the sector, the government has also allocated Rs 10 lakh crore in the Union Budget 2022-23.The truth remains that with the anticipated pace of infrastructure development, growth of skilled manpower will be the key. New technologies will reshape millions of jobs. Technology will be enabler for creating new types of jobs, digital technologies will change the ways of doing the job. Jobs requiring a combination of digital and non-cognitive skills is expected to tend to be better in demand. This will lead to a surge in the activities in the infrastructure sector resulting in increased employment opportunities.The big question remains is that whether India, having second largest network of road and rail with provision of continuous expansions in capacity, has enough resources in terms of skilled manpower to contribute and continue with the anticipated pace of development in years to come. On one side, resources are being allocated in different budgets for implementing of various projects but more importantly, we will need skilled and trained manpower in design and value engineering, risk management, project management capabilities specially for the major projects.The fact remains that the growth of skilled manpower has not kept pace with the increased demand. In the current scenario, we must review carefully what initiatives have been taken or to be taken by the government, corporates, academia in terms of basic skills development, digital transformation, employment of tools for monitoring and importantly, building long term capabilities to monitor the quality, cost and timelines of the projects being undertaken by various state and Centre governments.As per a report by IBEF, India has become the third-largest domestic aviation market in the world and is expected to overtake the UK to become the third-largest air passenger market by 2024 and India currently has the fifth-largest metro network in the world and will soon overtake advanced economies such as Japan and South Korea to become the third-largest network. As per ICRA , road construction will clock 16-21 per cent rise in FY24, while road construction activity is expected to pick up, EPC (engineering procurement construction) segment will continue to remain the mainstay of awarding, accounting for 70-75 per cent of awards in FY24. With such a pace of growth, structural capacity will be breached by 2022, or if growth trajectories resume soon, capacity limits will be brimmed even faster. As the world come to terms with the new normal, possibilities cannot be ignored.The government has also undertaken several steps to revitalize the highways and goods carriage infrastructure sector. It has a sound expansion potential.Government’s emphasis on self-reliance or ‘aatmanirbharata’ in the socio-economic development of the country has enabled India to pool in versatile professionals with expertise and skills across a vast and ramified spectrum of skillsets. The need for specialists with experience and expertise are required to offer sustainable solutions to Indian infrastructure needs. The demand for the services is expected to grow in India, promoting the growth of the consultancy sector.The demand-supply gap of skilled professionals will become a serious bottleneck in terms of quality, costs and timely completion of projects if there are no serious efforts from the government, academia, and corporate sector in the immediate future. It is equally important that new professional skills in digital transformation, latest technological advancement in designs, construction technology, project management are adopted to by upskilling human capital so that future generation staff can act as a change maker to the modern India.The infrastructure sector has been one of the prime drivers to boost the economic development and will always involve immense use of human capital and technology and unless we try to bridge the gap by upskilling our resources, the dream of achieving $5 trillion economy will be a distant dream. More diverse, widely geographically distributed skilled manpower in engineering as well as digital technology will pave the way for the future.To overcome the skill shortage in the infrastructure sector and ensure sustained growth, a multi-faceted approach is needed. Firstly, the government, academia, and corporate sector must collaborate to design and implement comprehensive skill development programs. These initiatives should focus on both traditional engineering skills and cutting-edge digital technologies, enabling the workforce to meet the demands of a rapidly-evolving industry.Secondly, there should be a strong emphasis on upskilling the existing workforce to adapt to the changing technological landscape. Investing in training and development programs will empower professionals to embrace digital transformation and adopt modern construction techniques.Furthermore, promoting vocational education and apprenticeship programmes will create a steady pipeline of skilled manpower. By engaging with educational institutions and industry experts, these initiatives can align the curriculum with the specific needs of the infrastructure sector.Moreover, the government should foster an environment that encourages research and innovation. This will attract top talent to the infrastructure domain and promote the development of advanced technologies.Lastly, promoting the growth of the consultancy sector can address the demand for specialized expertise. Engaging experienced professionals in consulting roles will enhance project efficiency and quality.By implementing these measures, India can bridge the skill gap and build a skilled workforce capable of supporting the ambitious growth targets of the infrastructure sector. A well-prepared workforce, equipped with the latest skills and knowledge, will not only accelerate economic development but also solidify India's position as a global economic powerhouse.(The writer is MD, India and South Asia, Egis)",0,industrial
India signals change through vessel age limits,"India is taking further steps to lower the footprint its shipping trade leaves. Several measures will be introduced, including the ban of tankers and bulkers older than 25 years, and gas and container vessels older than 30 years, from making port calls in India. Furthermore, secondhand vessels purchased that are older than 20 years will be refused Indian flag registration.

On the face of it, VesselsValue data shows the portion of the global fleet that would be excluded from trading with India is significant; 15% of the tanker fleet and 10% of the gas fleet will be taken out of the supply pool.

However, when observing the utilisation of these older vessels for journeys that end in India, VesselsValue trade data shows the scale of restrictions is fairly limited. Looking specifically at 2022 tanker journeys that completed in India, performed by vessels aged greater than 25 years, only 130 journeys were made, of which 105 were domestic, and by 11 unique vessels. The past year saw 6,259 journeys ending in India made by vessels younger than 25 years of age; this represents 98% of all tanker journeys.

*Tanker vessel types: VLCC, Suezmax, Aframax, Post Panamax MT, Panamax MT or Handy Tanker.

The distribution in age of bulkers whose journeys finish in Indian ports in 2022 further shows the proposed changes will not significantly limit the supply of vessels to the Indian market. Most vessels that visit India are built post-2009, and while the tail is long, it does not pose an immediate shock to the market.

While the proposed rules by India do not have a significant impact in terms of vessels restricted, they do signal an intention to reduce the environmental impact of global trade. The global fleet continues to be updated with more efficient vessels that use cleaner fuels with innovative green features on board. With that being said, those vessels that have either reached the end of their economic life, or those that operate inefficiently, may become limited in the markets that they can serve.",0,transport

Speaking to reporters, C Naveen Reddy, president of the Federation of Karnataka Lorry Owners’ Association, said, “Though the union government called us for discussions on this unruly law, the officials have not given anything in writing. This is a unilateral decision by the union government, and they did not consult us before arriving at such a hasty decision.”

Reddy also said that all truck drivers in the state will support the strike and keep their vehicles off-road. “We already informed all the truck drivers in the state, and we will be going on a strike. All heavy vehicles will go off-road from January 17,” he added.

Truck drivers, taxi and bus operators started a nationwide strike to oppose the provision of ₹7 lakh penalty and 10-year jail term for hit-and-run cases under the newly passed Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. The All-India Motor Transport Congress said that these provisions, which have yet to come into force, can lead to undue harassment and must be recalled with immediate effect.

However, on January 2, the All India Motor Transport Association (AIMTC) decided to end the nationwide truck drivers protests the new hit-and-run law, after a meeting with Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla. The government assured the members of the transport body that the new laws have not been implemented yet and will only be implemented after consultation with AIMTC.",1,transport
"Bengaluru’s Water Crisis Prompts Ban on Drinking Water for Non-Essential Needs, with a ₹5,000 Penalty","March 08, 2024 01:04 pm | Updated 11:04 pm IST - Bengaluru

In response to the water scarcity in Bengaluru and surrounding districts, the Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewage Board (BWSSB) has issued an order prohibiting the use of potable water for non-essential purpose, including washing vehicles, gardening, and for entertainment purposes like water fountains. Additionally, malls and theatres have been instructed to limit water usage to drinking, road construction, and cleaning purpose only.

The BWSSB has introduced fines for violators, starting at ₹5,000 and escalating to ₹500 per day for subsequent violations. Furthermore, the board has established a dedicated call centre (1916) for citizens to report any misuse of water. BWSSB Chairman Ram Prasath Manohar urged citizens to report violations, and assured swift action by the board.

The order has raised several questions, including how the ban on misuse of potable water will be enforced.

Sources in the BWSSB said while citizens are encouraged to report violations in their areas, assistant engineers will tour their jurisdictions to look for and book offenders.

Why the order had some residents worried

The order has sparked some concern, especially among residents of independent houses that have no access to treated water. While large apartments have been mandated to install in-situ Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) and have access to recycled water, there is no such facility in any independent house in Bengaluru.

This order from BWSSB comes a day after the Bengaluru Urban district administration capped the prices of water tankers at a maximum of ₹1,200 for a 12,000-litre load to be delivered within 10 km. However, the price cap too has raised concerns.

In most severely affected areas of south eastern Bengaluru and along Kanakapura Road, most water tanker dealers claim that most borewells in these areas have gone dry. They claim to be going as far as 20 km away one way to fetch water, and this is the norm in these areas now. Thus, the price cap offers little solace for those who have to bear skyrocketing tanker prices in these areas.",0,industrial
Nepal Earthquake 2015: Post Disaster Needs Assessment - Executive Summary - Nepal,"Background

Nepal is the 11th most earthquake-prone country in the world. Ever since the first recorded earthquake of 1255 AD that killed one-third of the population of the Kathmandu Valley and its King, Abhaya Malla, Nepal has experienced a major earthquake every few generations. The last great earthquake (of magnitude 8.4) in 1934 AD resulted in more than 10,000 deaths in the Kathmandu Valley. Most of the infrastructure and major heritage sites had to be rebuilt. There have since been earthquakes causing severe human and physical loss in 1980, 1988 and 2011.

On Saturday, 25 April 2015 at 11:56 local time, a 7.6 magnitude earthquake as recorded by Nepal’s National Seismological Centre (NSC), struck Barpak in the historic district of Gorkha, about 76 km northwest of Kathmandu. Nepal had not faced a natural shock of comparable magnitude for over 80 years. The catastrophic earthquake was followed by more than 300 aftershocks greater than magnitude 4.0 (as of 7 June 2015). Four aftershocks were greater than magnitude 6.0, including one measuring 6.8 which struck 17 days after the first big one with the epicentre near Mount Everest. To date, there are over 8,790 casualties and 22,300 injuries. It is estimated that the lives of eight million people, almost one-third of the population of Nepal, have been impacted by these earthquakes. Thirty-one of the country’s 75 districts have been affected, out of which 14 were declared ‘crisis-hit’ (see Figure 1) for the purpose of prioritizing rescue and relief operations; another 17 neighbouring districts are partially affected.

The destruction was widespread covering residential and government buildings, heritage sites, schools and health posts, rural roads, bridges, water supply systems, agricultural land, trekking routes, hydropower plants and sports facilities. The geodetic network centres including horizontal and vertical control points have been damaged in a manner that will affect reconstruction planning.

Rural areas in the central and western regions were particularly devastated and further isolated due to road damage and obstructions. In the worst hit areas, entire settlements, including popular tourist destinations like Langtang, were swept away by landslides and avalanches triggered by the earthquakes. Due to the weakened, ruptured, and destabilized slopes and surfaces, the vulnerable areas have now become even more susceptible to flooding and landslides that can occur during the monsoon.

Hundreds of historical and cultural monuments at least a century old were either destroyed or extensively damaged. Over half a million houses were destroyed. The damage exposed the weaknesses of houses that did not have any seismic-resistant features or were not in accordance with the building codes. The disaster also highlighted aspects of inequities in Nepali society spanning geography, income and gender. Poorer rural areas have been more adversely affected than towns and cities due to their inferior quality of houses. More women and girls died than men and boys, partly because of gendered roles that disproportionately assign indoor chores to women.

The time and day the first earthquake was experienced saved thousands of lives. Being a Saturday, the weekly holiday, schools across Nepal were closed on 25 April. The death toll of young people could have been much higher considering that nearly 7,000 schools were completely or significantly damaged. Similarly, if the earthquake had struck at night, and not in the middle of the day, there would certainly have been greater casualties.",0,natural
"10 Best Disaster Movies Set in a City, According to Rotten Tomatoes","Disaster films are prolific, popular, and genre-spanning — whether it’s an action-comedy or outright horror, there’s a movie to suit everyone. City-based disaster films are especially popular as they capture the everyday experiences. There’s a morbid thrill for viewers watching people just like themselves get blasted, frozen, flooded, or consumed by monsters. Even better if it’s a city everybody recognizes (which is why New York so often cops it).

Apart from being good fun, disaster films can also indicate how generations have processed natural disasters and global threats, such as San Francisco detailing the horrific 1906 California earthquake. They also capture social fears — The Day After and Threads reflect the Cold War era’s terror of nuclear conflict, and — more recently — The Day After Tomorrow, the fear of climate change.

While mostly a musical melodrama, San Francisco helped set the template for the modern disaster film — with big stars (Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy, and Jeanette MacDonald), impressive special effects, and even a signature song. The earthquake sequence is surprisingly still thrilling to watch today, especially considering the film was made almost 90 years ago.

1 ‘Threads’ (1984)

Image via the BBC

Rotten Tomatoes Score: 100%

This British TV film is considered by many to be the most terrifying movie of all time. Threads, set in the Northern English city of Sheffield, was the UK’s sister film to The Day After. The film follows two ordinary families devastated by a nuclear war and the following agonizing decade of fallout, death, and decay. Our main character, Ruth (Karen Meagher), survives the blast but dies of malnutrition and cancer in a little more than a decade. Jane, her emotionally and intellectually stunted daughter, has a stillborn, deformed baby at 13.

Told in a pseudo-documentary style (like the earlier and equally controversial The War Game), Threads is unflinchingly bleak. The viewer watches Sheffield (and its residents) get blown to bits and then consumed by fire, fallout, and rats. No happy survival tropes exist in this cautionary disaster film, no heroes saving the day, no humanity — no hope.

A Himalayan disaster and its aftermath,"Himachal Pradesh, which recently endured a tumultuous period battling extreme weather situations leading to devastating landslides, widespread damage and collapse of several buildings, is currently basking in bright sunlight. But the chaos of one-way traffic jams, detours, washed-away bridges, and the constant threat of landslides, as well as the absence of tourists, persist. The hill state faced a challenging two months, marked by excessive rainfall in July, followed by two unprecedented spells in August. With over 400 lives lost, this was Himachal’s one of the worst disasters in the past 100 years.

Unprecedented disaster

The three spells of excessive rain wreaked havoc in July and August. Extreme events such as flash floods, cloudbursts, landslides, subsidence, and sinking of land devastated lives and property especially in Mandi, Kullu, Manali, Shimla and in some parts of Kangra. As per the government’s assessment, the state suffered a loss of Rs 12,000 crore.

Current estimates indicate 404 people lost their lives, 38 still missing, and 377 injured. Besides, 10,140 livestock perished, and 5,644 cowsheds were destroyed. As many as 2,546 houses and 317 shops have been completely damaged, and 10,853 houses partially damaged leaving a large population to seek alternate places to live.

The rain-induced devastation left hundreds of roads; national highways, damaged. Several stretches of Kiratpur-Manali four-lane from Mandi to Manali and Kalka-Shimla four-lane from Parwanoo to Solan were washed away. The river Beas flowing alongside Kullu to Manali has left deep gorges, boulders and horrifying lumps of landslides.

Besides, several critical buildings and public utilities like schools, colleges and other educational institutes were also damaged. Many hydropower projects and transmission lines were damaged or rendered non-operational.

Natural or man-made disaster?

As per the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Himachal saw two days of vigorous activity on August 14 and 23 when it received extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places. Five Western disturbances approached the state during this month.

From July 7 to 10 , active to vigorous monsoon conditions prevailed with very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall in most parts of the state. The state received 734.4 mm rainfall (June-September) period against the normal of 223 mm.

The unprecedented rainfall resulted in widespread damage to public and private properties, overflowing of major rivers, blockage of roads, landslides, flashfloods, damage to bridges, and complete disruptions of electrical and communication system, including loss of human lives.

Guman Singh, coordinator of Himalaya Niti Abhiyan — a group working in the Himalayan region — told The Indian Express in Kullu, “From the very first day we are saying this is not a natural disaster but a man-made disaster. The construction work carried out, particularly by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), especially the four-lane highways from Kiratpur to Manali and Kalka to Shimla, has caused huge damage. In both four-lane projects, we saw huge destruction due to these flash floods. They did all kinds of unscientific engineering in this.

“Engineering solutions have so many other interests as there are government interests, economic interests, several other partners, businessmen, officials and corporate into it. This corrupt nexus has violated the process and has not followed the process in the scientific method to construct the roads. NHAI is the biggest criminal due to which this biggest disaster took place in Himachal.

Guman, who recently appealed to the Prime Minister to declare it a natural disaster, also emphasised the impact of hydroprojects in Himachal. “There should be limits on hydro projects in the state. The Himachal government itself has acknowledged that 21 such projects caused destruction as they disposed of debris into rivers and riverbeds, causing water levels in the Beas and Parvati rivers to rise. Additionally, the dams released water without prior warning, resulting in the complete devastation of the Sainj Valley market in Kullu and the Pandoh area in Mandi due to flooding.”

Role of NHAI and NHPC

Negligence in road widening efforts by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and shortcomings in water and disaster management practices of the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) have sparked outrage among experts, activists, and locals in Himachal Pradesh.

The recent calamity saw the complete destruction of the Kiratpur to Manali and Kalka to Shimla National Highways, leaving them vulnerable to further landslides. Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Sukhvinder S Sukhu, on August 16, emphasised the necessity of tunnels to alleviate the pressure of vehicular traffic on this route, citing the successful use of tunnels by the British to establish rail links between Kalka and Shimla. He urged NHAI to prioritise tunnel construction despite the associated costs.

The CM also pointed out the erroneous cutting of rocks during highway expansion as a contributing factor to landslides. He highlighted that hills should be cut at angles of 45 degrees, 60 degrees, or similar slopes, rather than the perilous 90-degree angle employed in various locations between Kalka and Shimla.

Abdul Basit, the regional head of NHAI, visited the Parwanoo-Solan project on August 12, and mentioned that NHAI has 68 tunnel projects, with 11 already completed and the rest under construction. He acknowledged the need for improvements in these projects compared to their predecessors.

Similarly, NHPC faced criticism for releasing excessive water without prior warnings, leading to devastation in Sainj Valley in Kullu, where over 80 houses were swept away. Similar incidents were reported in the Pandoh Dam area in Mandi and the Pong Dam in Kangra.

Himachal Pradesh hosts 75 hydropower projects, each with a capacity of 25 MW or more, with many situated in the most vulnerable districts. Locals in Sainj Valley blamed NHPC’s hydroelectric project for their losses, alleging illegal dumping of project waste near the Parvati River and releasing water without their knowledge, causing a significant rise in the river’s level and extensive damage.

One affected local, Ashok Kumar, expressed frustration with NHPC’s lack of outreach to the affected people, and they are considering legal action to seek compensation and rehabilitation. Senior Geomorphologist OP Bhuraita in Shimla highlighted that the hasty construction of hydropower projects has made earthquake-prone Himachal Pradesh even more susceptible to landslides. He criticised the rush to develop tourism infrastructure, harness power potential, and other infrastructure without adequately assessing environmental and societal impacts and addressing geological and tectonic instability in the region.

Politics of disaster

The political warfare in flood-affected Himachal Pradesh has intensified, with the Congress government, led by Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu, accusing the BJP-led Central government of turning a blind eye to the state’s plight and not showing interest in declaring it a natural disaster. Chief Minister Sukhu, in office for just eight months, highlights the substantial financial challenges, with a previous BJP government leaving a Rs. 75,000 crore loan burden and now a loss exceeding Rs. 12,000 crore due to the disaster. Sukhu is urging the Centre to provide a special package for state infrastructure rebuilding and reconstruction without discrimination.

Former Chief Minister and Leader of the Opposition, Jai Ram Thakur, rebuts these claims, emphasising that the state government should focus on requesting additional funds from the Centre rather than placing blame. Thakur acknowledges that the central government has provided significant assistance and intends to further support the state. He argues that the declaration of a natural disaster depends on specific parameters, and the state government’s focus on this may stem from an inability to compensate for the damages.

Regarding Sukhu’s claim of a Rs 75,000 crore loan during Jairam Thakur’s government, the former CM dismisses it as baseless and advises against blaming others. He highlights that the Virbhadra government had left a Rs 50,000 crore loan when he assumed office in 2017, and his administration took a Rs 5,000 crore loan over two years. In contrast, Sukhu’s government has borrowed Rs 8,000 crore in just eight months. Thakur explains that loans are often a necessity but can be managed, emphasising that Himachal can function without excessive borrowing.

Thakur also shares the financial assistance received from the Centre, including 364 crore in the first two installments, followed by 190 crores and an additional 200 crores. Additionally, 6,000 houses under rural housing schemes and an extra 2,700 crore under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) have been granted. He mentions Union Road Minister Nitin Gadkari’s commitment to covering the damages to four-lane roads and bridges within a one-kilometer radius.

However, State PWD Minister Vikramaditya Singh expresses dissatisfaction with the assistance received from the Centre, asserting that it falls short of what was expected. Despite the inclusion of centre-sponsored schemes, Singh contends that, given the unprecedented disaster’s impact exceeding Rs 10,000 crore, the state has received only meager sums from the Centre, describing it as an insult to the people of Himachal. He insists that the Centre should allocate at least 10 per cent of the total loss.

The road ahead

In the aftermath of the massive disaster, Chief Minister Sukhu is determined to usher in significant policy reforms and reevaluate development strategies. The government has imposed a temporary ban on tree felling and stone crushing activities in the state.

Regarding policy reforms, Vikramaditya Singh emphasised the need for a well-structured mining policy, emphasising that mining should be conducted scientifically. He stressed the importance of designated excavation sites, avoiding excessive mining in one area, and maintaining a safe distance from rivers. He also pointed out that a complete ban on mining and crushers is not a viable solution, as construction activities must continue in the state.

Guman advocates for a mountain-specific policy framework tailored to the Himalayan region. He underscores the necessity of conservation in Himachal, suggesting a shift away from large, multi-story structures in favor of smaller, environmentally friendly developments.

OP Bhuraita, who authored a paper on climate change titled ‘Sinking Himalayas – A classic example of ignored

warnings, planned destruction, and sidelining people,’ draws attention to the lack of learning from past disasters. He cites a similar catastrophe in 1997 in Jubbal block, Upper Shimla, where over 400 people lost their lives due to flash floods triggered by a cloudburst. Bhuraita asserts that the recent Himachal disaster had the same underlying causes. Despite recommendations made after the 1997 incident, such as not constructing in flood-prone areas, the government proceeded with the Andhra Khad project in the same location, inviting disaster once more.

Guman suggests decentralizing tourism to lesser-explored rural regions within the state, while Bhuraita calls for a slowdown in development speed and a reevaluation of the government’s ‘development paradoxes.’ He argues that the current development model is ill-suited to the mountainous terrain of Himachal Pradesh.

Bhuraita advocates for more careful, landslide-resistant two-lane roads instead of four-lane highways, cautioning against the dangers of rapid access to mountain areas. He highlights the recent prolonged closure of the Kalka-Shimla four-lane road due to landslides, emphasising the need for sustainable and resilient infrastructure in the region.

During the floods of 2023, various hydropower authorities across the Beas Basin were criticised for failing to open floodgates after the initial heavy rain spell from June 20 to 24, this year. Mishandled projects like these can become sources of disaster, as witnessed in Kullu-Mandi, Kangra, and parts of Punjab and Haryana, according to Guman Singh.

He underscores the urgent need to review and activate instruments such as Disaster Management Plans and Early Warning Systems and to update Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and dam manuals based on changing hydrology and socioenvironmental factors.",1,natural

Drought and climate change impacts on cooling water shortages and electricity prices in Great Britain,"Climate and hydrology

To assess the risk of low flows, large sets of climate timeseries were generated using the Weather@Home climate simulation system (W@H)28. W@H comprises an atmospheric global climate model, HadAM3P, and a regional climate model, HadRM3P, for generating dynamically downscaled projections, over the region of interest at 0.22° resolution (~25 km). W@H229 was adapted to produce 100 unique 30-year projections for three time slices: (i) one historical baseline (1975–2004); and two forced by the RCP 8.5 emission scenario (ii) NF (2020–2049) and (iii) FF (2070–2099). The outputs are mostly available at daily resolution, for 14 common climate variables including air temperature, bias-corrected precipitation, evaporation, wind speed, radiation, air pressure, soil moisture content and heat fluxes.

We used the hydrological model, DECIPHeR30, to simulate river flows from the W@H climate projections. DECIPHeR is a flexible hydrological modelling framework that explicitly characterises connectivity and fluxes across the landscape. It has previously been applied to 1366 gauges across Great Britain and shown to achieve good model performance in replicating hydrological behaviour across a range of catchments and flow conditions. DECIPHeR groups together similar parts of the landscape into hydrological response units (HRUs) to minimise run times of the model and enable it to run large ensembles of climate simulations and provide probabilistic flow simulations essential for risk analysis. In this study HRUs are classified by three classes of slope, accumulated area and the W@H climate grid to ensure the spatial variability of climatic inputs was represented. DECIPHeR was set up for 24 flow gauges located closest to the 32 power plants of interest (Supplementary Fig. 5). To calibrate the model, daily observed data of precipitation, potential evapotranspiration (PET) and discharge for a 30-year period from January 1, 1973 to December 31, 2003 were used to run and assess the model (Supplementary Fig. 1). National gridded 1 km2 estimates of rainfall and PET from the CEH gridded estimates of areal rainfall (CEH-GEAR; refs. 31,32) and CHESS-PE33 datasets were aggregated to the W@H grid and used to drive the model. For each gauge 10,000 parameter sets were sampled in a Monte Carlo simulation using wide parameter ranges tested in previous studies [13]. Model performance was evaluated against observed flow at each of the gauges from January 1, 1974 to December 31, 2003 using log Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency34 and root mean squared error, finding the former was best to reproduce flows below the 10th percentile flow (Q 90 ), our flow range of interest (Fig. 7). To represent hydrological model uncertainty, we then used the 100 best performing parameterisations (1%) to simulate flows for each of the W@H climate timeseries. This resulted in a total of 720,000 30-year daily flow simulations, consisting of 100 hydrological model parameterizations for each of the 100 30-year W@H projections for three time slices and 24 gauges.

Power plant availability

We use a set of 32 power plants, all of which are thermo-electric (coal, combined cycle gas turbines, municipal and industrial waste incineration and biomass), water-dependent plants cooled by either evaporative or hybrid cooling systems using water from freshwater bodies and ranging in nameplate capacity between 35 and 2400 MW e (refs. 35,36, Supplementary Table 4, Supplementary Fig. 5). Power plant availability is calculated at each of 33 power plants on a daily basis, by comparing simulated flows from DECIPHeR at each gauge with the hands off flow reductions determined by the environmental flow requirements and sectoral allocations. The EU Water Framework Directive also regulates water temperatures, although these have minimal impact on water use for evaporative cooling (as opposed to once through cooling) and thus are not considered here. Likewise, coastal thermo-electric power plants are also not constrained by freshwater availability. The current system plus (CSP) soft hands off flow regulatory regime for withdrawals from freshwater bodies was simulated, as proposed by UK Government during the abstraction reform process37,38,39. CSP incorporates sectoral allocations and environmental flow requirements, as calculated in ref. 38, with 10–20% allocated for EFR at Q 90 depending on the ecological sensitivity of the waterbody to abstraction38,40. If the no go below flow discharge is reached, typically set at 75% of the Q 99.9 , all abstraction must stop.

From Q 90 and up to that point, sectoral (and individual user) allocations are incrementally reduced (hands off flows), such that at Q 99 , only 10% of a user’s normal allocation is available. Since power plants are unlikely to operate at less than 30% nameplate capacity, in effect a power plant’s availability becomes 0 when the flow hits Q 97 (Supplementary Table 1) . Figure 3c of the results illustrates how seemingly small plant-level impacts accumulate during more severe drought events that impact multiple units.

Supply curves

The UK electricity supply market is designed for competition to promote least-cost for the consumer. This means for each half hour period of every day, suppliers bid to fulfil the expected, albeit unknown, demand. The cheapest supply is contracted to fulfil the demand, where the supply curve intersects the demand curve, so suppliers who have bid too high will not be called upon to generate. The price of electricity paid to all suppliers is the most expensive successful bid, known as the strike price. Note that suppliers bid based on their short-run marginal cost (SRMC), which is different to the levelized cost of electricity. For non-thermal renewables and nuclear, SRMC is very low as there are no or very little operational costs. For fuel-consuming plants, like coal and gas, SRMC is more dependent on the fuel costs. Nonetheless, it is impossible to obtain the true short-run marginal supply curve as the data are commercially sensitive.

To simulate the system, we developed a bespoke short-run marginal supply curve for generation capacity representing 893 power plants, with a cumulative nameplate capacity of 86,880 MW based on the Digest of UK Energy Statistics36. We used SRMC (Supplementary Table 5) from the National Grid Electricity Scenario Illustrator (ELSI) model, which is an integrated power market economic dispatch model41. SRMC were assigned to each unit based on central operational cost estimates for 35 technology types42. However, for the simulation in this study, a plant-by-plant ordered supply curve is necessary for the partial equilibrium calculation of the strike price. Thus, cost variation was added to each individual unit depending on the age (see Supplementary Note 1), such that newer (and more efficient) units would have marginally lower operational costs than older plants.

Wind and solar have the lowest short-run costs (once installed, operation costs are basically zero) yet their output (capacity factor) is never actually equivalent to the nameplate capacity due to the variable wind and solar radiation conditions. Thus, the unadjusted supply curve is adjusted to represent low, medium and high estimate levels of combined wind and solar generation, in a method similarly used in ELSI and the UK Government’s Dynamic Dispatch Model43. Using daily production values from the years 2013 to 201644, 10th, 50th and 90th percentile daily production values for wind and solar were calculated (Supplementary Fig. 6), for each month, yielding three adjusted supply curves per month, 36 in total (Supplementary Fig. 7). For the rest of the generation capacity from other sources, capacity availability is assumed to be 100%, except for when thermal capacity is impacted by low flows as described above. This enables us to the test the sensitivity of low to high renewables production scenarios, whilst keeping the meteorological impacts more strictly focused on the electricity production impacted by low flows. Other studies investigating the variability of renewables explore this issue more comprehensively45,46. We also assessed the sensitivity to fuel prices, adjusted ±25% for coal, gas, biomass and oil (Supplementary Table 5, Supplementary Fig. 8).

Electricity demand model

We estimate a statistical model of daily electricity demand and strike price, including weather variables as co-variates. There is ample empirical data for electricity demand and price, so we use a machine-learning gradient boosting regression trees algorithm47,48 with the Huber loss function49, chosen for its ability to handle mixed datatypes and robustness to outliers when compared with squared error loss. The input variables for training the model were minimum, mean and maximum air temperature, mean wind speed, mean windchill, month, week number and day type (weekday or weekend). Windchill was calculated using temperature and wind speed inputs50. For observed climate variables, we used the UK Met Office MIDAS dataset51 for 2012–2017 inclusive, to derive a single GB climate timeseries, by population-weighting52 weather station data from 13 urban-area weather stations corresponding to the 13 most populous urban areas in Great Britain (Supplementary Table 2). The effect of this is significant with adjustment of −3 to +4 °C for the temperature timeseries compared with the unweighted average (Supplementary Fig. 2). Public holidays were also removed to improve model fit.

For input daily electricity demand, we re-sampled 5-min electricity production and demand data from Elexon/Sheffield University and processed by Gridwatch44. We used the k-folds (k = 10) cross-validation method53 to validate the model performance against unseen independent data (Supplementary Fig. 3). The model is trained and tested multiple times on k subsamples of the data, achieving r2 coefficient of 0.81, cross-validation score of 0.87 and percentage bias in overall electricity demand of −0.08%. Performance of the model was assessed in further ways to determine suitable representation of key features. These include fit of the load duration curve (LDC) (Fig. 8), representing seasonal, monthly and weekly profiles (Fig. 9, Supplementary Fig. 4), in addition to the statistical measures used in the cross-validation (Supplementary Fig. 3) and the methods. The LDC fits the observed period well, closely tracking the median LDC for the period (Fig. 8a). In addition, the climate uncertainty in grey lines all fall within the expanded observed uncertainty range (pink), which includes not only weather variability but also considerable socioeconomic factors. Slightly warming temperatures under climate change, not including socioeconomic changes and responses, we can see a slight flattening of the LDC with slightly less electricity used in wintertime (Fig. 8b). Percentage values of deviation are small across the distribution (Supplementary Table 3,, Supplementary Fig. 4). In timeseries format, the model output regular and cyclical, representing the key seasonal behaviour, as well as the weekly profile with lower demands at weekends (Fig. 9c).

To generate daily electricity demand for the simulations, the daily gridded climate output data from W@H2 was population weighted using data from as inputs for the model (Supplementary Table 2).

Simulating price impacts

The merit order supply curve is typically determined by individual producers bidding (committing units) to provide a certain level of power at a designated time period and for a minimum price. Initial market supply price (strike price) is calculated at the intersection of demand with the supply curve. All plants that have bid below this supply price on the curve are now contracted to supply and will be paid the full strike price per unit of electricity supplied. This arrangement minimizes costs to the consumer whilst paying all suppliers the same commodity price.

When capacity is unavailable due to the low flows, the model removes this capacity from the supply curve on a daily basis. Depending on which plants are impacted and their position on the merit order, this shifts various parts of the curve to the left, resulting in a higher strike price to meet the same demand, as more expensive capacity has filled the gap. The new strike price is now paid to all suppliers up to that demand. In normal markets, changing prices would result in slight adjustments to demand, due to price–demand elasticities. However, this is not the case in the short term for wholesale electricity markets, because consumers are buffered by the retail market, for which the prices are only adjusted on much longer timescales, e.g. every few months or even annually when customers renew their contracts.

New Delhi ranks among the world's top polluted cities every year ahead of the onset of winter when calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants from sources including vehicles, industries, construction dust, and crop residue burning in nearby fields.

A thick smog shrouded the federal secretariat and president's palace in the heart of the city early on Monday, local time, and lowered visibility in other parts, as public outrage over hazardous air quality had grown.

As a result, the city extended the closure of primary schools until November 10.

The local government said that it would impose the ""odd-even"" vehicle rule from November 13-20 to mitigate pollution levels that are expected to rise after the Hindu festival of Diwali on November 12, when firecrackers are often set despite a ban.

The rule would allow vehicles with odd registration numbers on the road on odd dates and similarly vehicles with even numbers on alternate days.

Environmental experts have previously said that the rule, which has been imposed multiple times with some variations since 2016, has been more effective in de-congesting roads and less effective in bringing down pollution.

""In view of rising pollution, odd-even will be imposed in Delhi,"" Gopal Rai, the local environment minister, told reporters.

He added that a meeting will be held with the police and transport department on Tuesday to decide on the implementation.

Air quality was ""severe"" for a third consecutive day in the city on Monday, making it the second most polluted city in the world, behind Lahore in Pakistan, according to a real-time compilation by Swiss group IQAir.

A cricket World Cup match involving Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, however, went ahead in the city on Monday with organisers installing air purifiers in the players' dressing rooms and using water sprinklers to reduce pollutants in the air.

Curbs on vehicles are in addition to a ban on construction work for public projects in the national capital region, and restrictions on entry of trucks and heavy vehicles in Delhi, imposed by a federal pollution control watchdog on Sunday.

An analysis of 25 research studies by the Down To Earth magazine, published on Sunday, showed that poor air quality was linked to low birth weight, preterm delivery, stillbirth, developmental delay, restricted growth in children and even death.
